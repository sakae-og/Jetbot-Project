## 1) data_collection-Jetbot_Joystick.ipynb

Modified collision_avoidance data collection Notebook from Jetbot GitHub to allow driving and steering using gamepad joystick while image acquisition by gamepad buttons.

### a) Script contains: 
   * Joystick coordinate system transformation: based on user Pedro Werneck (https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/19669/algorithm-for-mixing-2-axis-analog-input-to-control-a-differential-motor-drive)
   * Gamma scaling for motor values
   * display of joystick,  left and right engine values
   * gamepad buttons for image aqcuisition (free, blocked)
   * graphical buttons of orginal script remain active

### b) Issues: 

   * Notebook has not been clean-up (display repetitions).
   * Scale range for motors is -0.5 to 0.5.
   * Gamma value can be between 1-4
   * Gamepad: Xbox USB: joystick (controller.axes: x:0, y:1)
   * Image acquisition: button (5: free, 7: blocked)
   * Inital speed restriction by â€¦. transform=lambda x: -x/2) in the fourth cell.
  
   * Excel file: test different steering strategies
  
 ## 2) Object recognition
 	* Goal: reduce time lag
	
## 3) Adjustments
* High CPU usage by jetpot_stats.service if jetbot OLED display is not installed or used
** Solution:
```
#check if jetbot_stats.service is in the folder 
$ cd /etc/systemd/system/
$ ls
#stop service
$ systemctl stop jetbot_stats #start service in case: systemctl start jebot_stats
#remove from starting at boot up
$ systemctl disable jetbot_stats
#delete the file
$ rm /etc/systemd/system/jetbot_stats.service

#if the service is required again then follow using "SD card from scratch" point 10.
```
